            <h2>Pre Biotransferance</h2>
            <div>
                <p>
                    Long before humanity even exsisted, There was a race called the Necrontyr. 
                    The Necrontyr was an increably advanced empire that was able to span most of the Milky Way Galaxy.
                    Unfortantly for them, Due to solar winds and UV rays, They had what they thought as a short lifespan.
                    While they grew their empire, The Necrontyr discoved a race called "The Old Ones".
                    The Necrontyr asked the Old Ones to share their secrets for immoratlity.
                    The Old Ones refused, fearing that the Necrontyr could threaten their empire, 
                    and thus started The War in Heaven.
                </p>
            </div>
            <h2>The War in Heaven</h2>
            <div>
                <p>
                    The War in Heaven was fought between the Necrontyr and the Old Ones.
                    Durring this war, the Necrontyr was on the back foot because of the Old Ones' ablity to create anything from thin air.
                    Also, The Old Ones created a new race called the Aeldiar to fight along side them.
                    It was at this point where the Necrontyr was chased back to their homeworld. The had given up all hope of winning
                    untill they spotted Jellyfish like things eating sons that they called The C'tan.
                </p>
            </div>
            <h2>The C'tan</h2>
            <div>
                <p>
                    The C'tan are physical aspects of the materal realm like death, technology, and deception. 
                    When one of these beings die, the aspect they represent will cease to exist. These Gods made a deal
                    with the leader of the Necrontyr named Szarekh. They offered to make the Necrontyr immortal and defeat the Old Ones in exchange for their souls.
                    Szarekh agreed to this and had a person called Szares to build a machine called The Biotransferance Machine.
                </p>
            </div>
            <h2>The End of The War in Heaven</h2>
            <div>
                <p>
                    With the help of the C'tan and their new metal bodies, the newly formed Necrons were able to overpower The Old Ones.
                    Unfortantly they did not go quietly and created a new species known as the Korks in a deprite attempt to turn the tide of war.
                    This last ditch effort did not change the outcome the outcome an the Old Ones were eraticated.
                </p>
                <p>
                    With this victory in hand, the Necrons went back to the C'tan to reclaim their souls.
                    The C'tan known as "The Deciver" told Szarekh that they ate the Necrons' souls.
                    Having so easily decived, the Necrons lead a revolution ageinst the C'tan and won.
                    Most of the C'tan were shattered and used as a powersource for the Necrons, but one known as "The Flayer" was killed.
                    When The Flayer was killed, it relesed a virus that turns Necrons into flesh hungry beings with no possible way of quenching it.
